I decided to make some content with lists because they tend to be easier to read. Lists make a clear separation of content and provide a simple structure to digest.

Additionally, I think this could be a good starting point to generate some discussions around. Hopefully, you can agree on some of my opinions, but I know that's improbable, at least.
